                <h3>About Domenic:</h3>
                 <p>Domenic Pennetta is a scientific illustrator originally based in Northwest Ohio. Through art, Domenic explores many scientific disciplines such as biology and invertebrate zoology, ecology, and paleontology. He works traditionally and digitally to create illustrations for clients worldwide, including researchers and professors, publishers, businesses, and nonprofits. Domenic holds a bachelor's certificate in Fine Art and a minor in Biology from the University of Toledo, Ohio. His work aims to promote enthusiasm for scientific topics and research among the general public. Domenic has also worked for the National Museum of the Great Lakes in Toledo, Ohio as their Communications Coordinator—influencing him to explore the wildlife of the Great Lakes in his most recent work.</p>

<p>Additionally, he creates speculative biology art depicting exobiological forms of life using fundamental scientific concepts. In 2021, Domenic founded a biannual speculative biology magazine called "<a href="https://www.astrovitae.com/">Astrovitae</a>" where he collaborates with other creators to curate and showcase their projects online. The magazine has proved beneficial for many artists at the beginning of their careers, offering them an opportunity to learn important writing skills and have their work published for the first time.</p>
  
<p>Domenic is always looking for commissions and collaborative opportunities. If you want to work with Domenic, feel free to reach out <a href="contact.html">via email!</a></p>
